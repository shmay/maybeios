<h1><a href='#' id='x'>X</a><span id='d'>Maybe</span></h1>

<p>Maybe allows you to see who of your friends & family are currently at your favorite spots.</p>

<p>Are they there?  Yes / No / Maybe</p>

<p><b>Pro Tip:</b> Turn Wi-Fi <b>ON</b> in your iOS settings for good location tracking.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<div class="question"> Who can invite people to spots? </div>
<div class="answer"> Only the creator of the spot. </div>

<div class="question">How does Maybe work?</div>
<div class="answer"> When you join or create a spot, Maybe creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence">Geo-fence</a> on your phone at that spot. When you enter or leave that Geo-fence, Maybe transmits the YES/NO binary data to our server. </div>

<div class="question"> Is Maybe secure? </div>
<div class="answer"> Yes. All data is sent through SSL, and we've gone to extra measures to keep your location status safe from any would-be hackers. </div>

<div class="question"> Does Maybe track my location? </div>
<div class="answer"> Sort of. It only knows if you've entered or left a Geo-fence. You can disable/enable these Geo-fences at anytime. </div>

<div class="question"> Does Maybe keep a history of my location? </div>
<div class="answer"> No. We only store the absolutely necessary information - whether you are currently within a Geofence or not (if we even know that) </div>

<div class="question"> How did Maybe come to be? </div>
<div class="answer"> Maybe was conceived by Andrew Graunke and built by Kyle Murphy, using Swift, Firebase, Node.js, and elbow grease </div>
